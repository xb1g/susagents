Each CSR consists of a main body text and corresponds to one or more Policy Areas; the main body text is split into sub-CSRs, each of which has a corresponding Policy Area as well. Each excel row is marked as 'X.Y' in the CSR number column, where X corresponds to the main CSR and Y to the sub-CSRs it is comprised of. CSRs, sub-CSRs and Policy Areas are represented in the SustainGraph through CSR, CSRSubpart and PolicyArea nodes respectively."
